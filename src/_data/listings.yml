      You can set up filtering groupings (called filter collections).
      This will determine what filters are used and how they are grouped together.

      These tags will consider a listing as available. 
      A tag not part of this list, or part of the disqualification tags, will be considered a descriptive tag.

      Tags that will disqualify a listing. This is useful if you want to hide listings that have been sold or are not available.
      A tag not part of this list, or part of the available tags, will be considered a descriptive tag.
