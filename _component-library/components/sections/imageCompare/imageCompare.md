## Overview
**Introduction:** The Image Compare component allows users to compare two images interactively by using a sliding bar to reveal differences between the left and right images. This feature is perfect for before-and-after showcases, product comparisons, or any visual content where highlighting changes is essential.

**Key Features:** 
- Interactive sliding bar that enables users to control the reveal of two overlapping images.
- Customizable image orientation (landscape or portrait) to suit different types of visual content.
- Includes title, description, and optional call-to-action buttons to enhance the component’s context and functionality.
- Supports custom color schemes to ensure seamless integration with your website’s branding.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for before-and-after visuals, such as home renovations, beauty transformations, or product improvements.
- Useful for product comparisons, enabling users to see differences between versions or models.
- Perfect for service showcases, demonstrating changes achieved through your offerings, like editing, detailing, or repairs.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using images that are too similar, as the comparison slider will have minimal impact and may confuse users.
- Do not use images with different orientations (portrait vs. landscape).
- Ensure that both images are of high quality and visually aligned to prevent an inconsistent or distracting experience.
- Make sure aspect ratios of the images is similar. For example, combing a 16x9 image with a 3x4 image won't work well.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use high-contrast images that clearly show differences to maximize the impact of the comparison.
**Troubleshooting:** 
- If the slider does not function correctly, check the live site, as slider interaction does not work in preview mode.
- If one of the images doesn't look right compared to the other, chances are that you have aspect ratios that are too different.

## Ideas
**Suggested Combinations:** Pair this component with a testimonial section to provide context and social proof for the comparison showcased.
