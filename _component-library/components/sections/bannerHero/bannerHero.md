## Overview
The Banner Image Hero component is a large, visually impactful section designed to appear at the top of a page. It displays a full-width background image with an dark overlay effect, accompanied by a prominent headline and optional buttons for calls to action. This section is commonly used for supporting pages. 

The component includes customizable overlay opacity, content alignment, and color settings. Itâ€™s optimized for high-quality images, making it versatile for a wide range of page types and styles. 

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for supporting pages (such as the contact, services, about us) where your business wants to showcase a hero image that captures attention instantly, but isn't over the top.
- Useful for product or service landing pages where visual appeal and a strong call to action are needed.
- Effective as a lead-in section for content-heavy pages, creating an engaging entry point.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- We DO NOT recommend using this for the homepage. This is better used in supporting pages where the hero section is less important
- Avoid using low-resolution images, as they may appear pixelated or stretched in full-width mode.
- Avoid adding too much text or too many buttons, which can clutter the design and detract from the main message.
- Ensure that the text and button colors contrast with the background image to maintain readability.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use high-contrast colors or select images that naturally contrast with your text to ensure the headline and buttons remain readable.
- **Troubleshooting:** If the overlay opacity seems too light or too dark, adjust the background opacity setting to improve text visibility without overpowering the image.
