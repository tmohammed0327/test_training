## Overview
**Introduction:** The Image Gallery Masonry 5 component displays images in a masonry layout, perfect for showcasing visuals in a creative, staggered format. This component displays images in sets of 5; any images beyond a complete set of 5 will not be displayed, making it ideal for collections that fit well in this structure.

**Key Features:** 
- Masonry grid layout that arranges images in varied sizes, creating a unique visual flow.
- Displays images in sets of 5, ensuring the grid remains balanced and visually cohesive.
- Responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes, providing an attractive layout on both desktop and mobile.
- Customizable color scheme and optional call-to-action buttons for enhanced user engagement.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for portfolios or galleries where artists, photographers, or designers want to display collections in a visually compelling format.
- Suitable for showcasing product images, offering an artistic and modern presentation.
- Works well on event or location pages, providing an engaging way to display curated images.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using fewer than 5 images, as the layout is optimized for complete sets of 5.
- Do not add images in non-multiples of 5, as any extras beyond the last complete set of 5 will be ignored.
- Ensure images are of high quality to make the most of the masonry layout, which emphasizes visual appeal.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use high-quality images and consistent orientation to create a cohesive, professional-looking gallery.
- **Troubleshooting:** If images are not displaying correctly, confirm that they are added in sets of 5, as the component will ignore additional images.

## Ideas
