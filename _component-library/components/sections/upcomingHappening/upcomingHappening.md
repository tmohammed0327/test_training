## Overview

**Key Features:** 
- **Event Countdown Timer:** Automatically counts down to the event's start time, showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds (active on live site).

- **Dynamic Date Formatting:** Converts event time to the user’s local timezone on the live site for added convenience.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:**

- Useful for landing pages where the countdown adds urgency and motivates users to take action.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- This section is specifically designed for upcoming events.
- Avoid too many tags if they clutter the display and detract from the event’s core details.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Pair with a "Simple Call To Action" section for encouraging sign-ups or RSVPs.
**Troubleshooting:** 
If the countdown is incorrect it is likley that you did not set up the happening's date and time in UTC format. Make sure that the date and time for the happening is UTC time and not your local time
