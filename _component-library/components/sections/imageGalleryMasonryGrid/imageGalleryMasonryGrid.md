## Overview
**Introduction:** The Image Gallery Masonry 8 component displays images in a dynamic masonry layout, ideal for showcasing visuals in a more artistic and staggered format. This component works in sets of 8 images; any images beyond a multiple of 8 will not be displayed. It’s ideal for visual collections where the structure of a masonry layout adds aesthetic value.

**Key Features:** 
- Masonry grid layout that organizes images in varied sizes for an engaging visual experience.
- Displays images in sets of 8, ensuring a balanced layout without overflow.
- Responsive design adapts to screen size, keeping images well-arranged on both desktop and mobile.
- Customizable color schemes and optional call-to-action buttons to enhance interactivity.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for portfolios where artists, photographers, or designers want to display collections in a more dynamic and visually appealing format.
- Suitable for galleries of product images, allowing users to view a variety of items at once without a rigid grid structure.
- Effective for event or location showcases, presenting a curated selection of images in a modern style.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using fewer than 8 images, as the layout is optimized for complete sets of 8.
- Do not add non-multiples of 8 images, as any extra images beyond the last complete set of 8 will be ignored.
- Ensure high-quality images to make the most of the masonry layout’s emphasis on visual appeal.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use multiples of 8 images to fully utilize the layout. Consistent image quality and orientation can enhance the overall appearance.
- **Troubleshooting:** If images are not displaying as expected, ensure they are added in sets of 8, as the component will ignore any extras.
