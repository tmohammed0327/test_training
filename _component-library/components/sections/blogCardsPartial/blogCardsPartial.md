## Overview
**Introduction:** The Blog Cards - 3 Posts component displays a selection of three blog posts in a visually appealing card layout. Each card includes the blog post's title, author, date, estimated reading time, and tags. This component is ideal for highlighting recent or random posts.

**Key Features:** 
- Displays only three posts, which can be customized to show the most recent, or randomly selected content.
- Customizable color scheme and card layout style to match the design of the website.
- Automatically pulls blog post metadata, making it easy to maintain without additional updates.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for homepages or landing pages where a quick preview of posts can engage visitors, which means they stay on your website longer, which means better SEO results.
- Suitable for product or service pages to add blog-related content that provides more information or context.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using this component on the dedicated blog page, as it is limited to displaying only three posts.
- Do not add excessive text to the title or author fields, as this can lead to layout issues or visual clutter.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** If you want to randomize the posts shown, enable the randomization setting for this component. This can create a fresh look for returning visitors.
- **Troubleshooting:** If you forgot to set your posts image, you'll see the default blog image (found in your websites data files). Don't forget to add an image to your post.
