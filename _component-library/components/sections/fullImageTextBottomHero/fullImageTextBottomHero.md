## Overview
**Introduction:** The Full Screen Image Text Bottom Hero component displays a full-screen background image with text content positioned at the bottom. It includes an eyebrow, headline, description, and call-to-action buttons, designed to engage users with a bold visual experience while keeping the focus on key messaging at the screen’s base.

**Key Features:** 
- Full-screen background image with adjustable overlay opacity for improved text readability.
- Content positioned at the bottom of the screen for a unique layout, drawing attention to the text without obstructing the image.
- Customizable text fields, including an eyebrow, headline, description, and buttons, providing flexibility for promotional or informational content.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Best for when you have a small amount of description text to go with the headline
- Ideal for landing pages or homepages, where a bold, introductory image with key information can make a memorable impact.
- Suitable for event or promotional pages where a high-contrast image and concise message can drive user action.
- Works well as an entry point for a site’s main call-to-action, guiding users naturally from visual engagement to interaction.

**Common Missteps:** 
- This section should not be used if you have a large amount of text. 
- Avoid using low-contrast images that may reduce text readability, even with an overlay.
- Do not overload the component with excessive text or buttons, as the bottom alignment benefits from a clean, concise presentation.
- Ensure the image quality is high, as a low-resolution image may detract from the professional look of the section.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Adjust the overlay opacity to enhance readability without sacrificing the impact of the background image.
