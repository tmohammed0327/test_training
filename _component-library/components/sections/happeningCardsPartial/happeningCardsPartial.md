## Overview
**Introduction:** The Happening Cards component displays up to 3 happenings or blog post cards, each showing a title, date, image, and tags. This component is designed to highlight a curated selection of recent or upcoming happenings, allowing users to quickly view relevant details. It's ideal for sections of a website where limited event or news previews are needed.

**Key Features:** 
- Compact card layout that displays up to three events or posts, providing a clean, organized preview.
- Includes filtering capabilities, with automatic updates for live sites, ensuring only relevant content is shown.
- Customizable background color and card styles to align with website branding.
- Automatic time zone adjustment for event times on live sites, displaying dates in the viewerâ€™s local time.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for homepages where a preview of upcoming events or recent news is beneficial.
- Use the tag filter to focus in this section. Example of focuses could be announcements, promotions, sales, or events
- Useful on event or news pages to provide a quick summary of current or featured happenings.
- Effective on community or company announcement pages, offering a snapshot of recent or significant events.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using this component if more than three events or posts are needed; instead, consider the "Happening Cards Full" section instead.
- Do not add lengthy titles, as this can make the card layout appear cluttered.
- Ensure high-quality images are used for each card to maintain a professional and visually appealing layout.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
**Pro Tip:** Keep titles short and use concise summaries to maintain a clean, engaging look.
**Troubleshooting:** 
- If times display incorrectly, it is likely that the time that was set up for the happening was not in UTC time. Make sure that the time on the happenings page is set in UTC time and not your local time.
- Double check your tags to make sure you aren't filtering out any happenings by accident. Leave the tag field blank to show all.

## Ideas
**Suggested Combinations:** Combine this component with a "Full Screen Image Hero" to introduce the event or blog section, or follow it with a "Call to Action" to prompt further engagement with upcoming happenings.
