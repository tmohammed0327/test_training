## Overview
**Introduction:** The Side By Side Animation component creates an interactive section where text and images appear side by side with animated transitions as users scroll. This component is ideal for storytelling, highlighting key features, or showcasing sequential content with visual support, providing an engaging and dynamic user experience.

**Key Features:** 
- **Scroll Animation:** As users scroll, images and text transition smoothly into view, enhancing engagement and visual flow.
- **Side-by-Side Layout:** Displays images and descriptive text in a side-by-side format, maintaining readability while allowing visuals to complement the message.
- **Image Positioning:** Offers flexibility in image positioning (left or right), enabling versatile layouts for various content types.
- **Visual Interest:** Optional dot or cross patterns can overlay the images, adding texture and visual interest for a modern aesthetic.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for storytelling sections on product or service pages, highlighting sequential steps or features.
- Effective on about or portfolio pages, where each image and description represents a different project or aspect of the business.
- Useful for educational content, where each side-by-side section illustrates a different concept or benefit.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using excessive text in each section, as it may reduce readability and detract from the animation effect.
- Do not use low-quality images, as they will be highly visible and may lessen the overall impact.
- Ensure that image and text content are cohesive to avoid confusing the viewer as they scroll through the animations.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use high-quality images and concise, impactful text to maintain a professional appearance and keep users engaged.
- **Troubleshooting:** The animation will not work while in the editing preview. The animation will work on the live site.
