## Overview
**Introduction:**  
The Bottom Image Hero is a visually striking section designed to feature key messaging with a supporting image below. It combines a hero-style heading with an impactful image, creating a dynamic focal point for landing pages or key content sections.

**Key Features:**  
- **Hero Heading:** Eye-catching headline with optional eyebrow and description text.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Top and bottom background color options for seamless design integration.
- **Supporting Benefits:** Includes a list of supporting benefits or features.
- **Full-Width Image:** A visually impactful image positioned below the content.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:**  
- Highlighting a product, service, or event with a bold visual.
- Landing pages with a need for strong visual engagement.
- Key messaging or announcements, paired with an attention-grabbing image.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:**  
- Avoid using low-quality or irrelevant images, as they can detract from the overall impact.
- Donâ€™t overcrowd the benefits section with too many points; focus on concise, high-impact messaging.
- Ensure the text and image contrast well with the background colors for readability.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
**Pro Tip:** 
- In the styles section you'll see two colors. The bottom color should match the background color of the section right after the hero.
- This section works best with landscape style images.

**Troubleshooting:** Images have max height equal to the size of this screen. Portrait style images may look cut off at large screen sizes because of this. Play around with the y axis position if you see this happen with your portrait image.
