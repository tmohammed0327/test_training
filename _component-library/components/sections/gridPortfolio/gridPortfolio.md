## Overview
**Introduction:** The Image Grid Portfolio component displays a grid of images, ideal for showcasing a portfolio, gallery, or visual content collection. Each image can include a title and description that appears on hover, creating an interactive experience for users. This layout is useful for visually-driven pages where multiple images need to be presented in a structured and engaging way.

**Key Features:** 
- Multi-column grid layout with images organized across three columns.
- Hover effect reveals a title and description overlay, allowing for additional context without cluttering the layout.
- Supports modal pop-ups for a more detailed view of each image when clicked.
- Customizable color scheme and overlay opacity to ensure readability and style alignment.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- This section looks best when you have 2,5, or 8 images. This is not a requirement.
- Ideal for portfolio pages, where designers, photographers, or artists can showcase their work in a clean, organized layout.
- Suitable for product galleries, case studies, or image-based testimonials where visual content is essential.
- Works well on homepages or service pages to provide a quick, visual overview of past projects, services, or featured items.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using low-quality images, as they may appear pixelated or unprofessional in a grid layout.
- Do not overload the grid with too many images, as this can make the page load slowly and overwhelm users.
- Ensure that titles and descriptions are brief to prevent the overlay from covering too much of the image.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use high-quality images and concise descriptions for each item to maintain a clean, professional appearance.
- **Troubleshooting:** If images do not display correctly in the grid, ensure they are optimized for web and maintain consistent dimensions.

## Ideas
**Suggested Combinations:** Pair this component with a "Full Screen Image Hero" at the top of the page to introduce the portfolio, or follow it with a "Colored Call to Action" to encourage users to reach out for more information or services.
