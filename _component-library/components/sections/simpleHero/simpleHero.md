## Overview
**Introduction:** The Simple Hero component introduces a page with a strong visual heading, often acting as the first section users see. With customizable headings, subheadings, descriptions, and buttons, this hero section is perfect for delivering a clear and compelling message.

**Key Features:** 
- **Prominent Headline:** Includes a primary heading (H1) and optional eyebrow text to make a strong first impression.
- **Supporting Description:** Provides space for additional descriptive text, giving users more context about the page or brand.
- **Action-Oriented Buttons:** Optional buttons can drive users toward key actions, such as "Learn More" or "Get Started."
- **Custom Alignment:** Offers flexible alignment options for the text and content, enabling you to adapt the layout to different styles and preferences.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Ideal for page introductions, setting the tone for the rest of the content.
- Effective on landing pages, where the focus is on engaging users quickly and driving conversions.
- Useful as a headline section on any page, drawing attention to the primary message or offering.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid overcrowding with too much text; keep the message clear and concise.
- Avoid using vague language; make sure the headline clearly reflects the purpose of the page or action desired.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use a compelling call to action in the button to encourage user engagement.
- **Troubleshooting:** If the text or buttons donâ€™t align as expected, double-check the alignment settings within the component.
