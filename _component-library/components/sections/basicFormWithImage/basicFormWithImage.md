## Overview
**Introduction:** The Form Overlapping Image section is a visually appealing section designed to present a form overlaid on an image. This layout is effective for capturing user information alongside a compelling visual, making it suitable for lead generation, sign-ups, and other interactions. The overlapping design adds a modern, layered effect, making it visually engaging.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Great for homepage sections or landing pages where you want to capture leads or sign-ups without taking users away from the main content.
- Useful on event, service, or product pages to capture leads interested without sending them to a generic contact page.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- Avoid using overly busy images, as they may distract from the form, which means less people fill it out.
- Landscape images work with this section, but portrait is better.
- Avoid adding too many form fields, as this can overwhelm the user and detract from the simplicity of the design. This is best used for simple forms with less than 6 fields
- Ensure the form's color scheme compliments the colors of the image.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Troubleshooting:** The image does not grow with the forms size. This is why we recommend this section only for simple forms with only a few fields

## Ideas
**Suggested Combinations:** Pair with a testimonial section above or below the form to remind people that others have benefited from your great service to help motivate them to fill out the form.
