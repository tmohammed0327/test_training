## Overview
**Introduction:** The Large Embed section allows for the embedding of external media or custom content, such as YouTube or Vimeo videos, or custom HTML embeds. This section is ideal for showcasing video content or other embedded media in a prominent and visually appealing way.

**Key Features:** 
- **Embed Options:** Choose between a video embed (YouTube or Vimeo) or a custom HTML embed (such as for calendly, google maps, and anything else that can be embedded).
- **Auto-resizing** for responsive design, ensuring embeds fit various screen sizes.
- **Color Customization:** Background and text colors can be tailored to match the site’s design.
- **Notification for Custom Embed Limitations:** Provides guidance on handling script-based or custom embed display issues when editing versus live site viewing.

## Best use cases
**Examples of Effective Use:** 
- Embedding a featured video, like a product demonstration or welcome message, on a homepage.
- Showcasing an external interactive widget, such as a map or event feed.
- Highlighting important video testimonials or tutorials directly within a content section.
- Video sales letter on a sales page.

## How **NOT** to use this
**Common Missteps:** 
- If an embed contains code in `<script></script>` tags, that code will not work while editing, but will work on the live site.
- Avoid using non-responsive custom embeds without proper testing, as they may not display well on smaller screens.

## FAQ, pro tips, and troubleshooting
- **Pro Tip:** Use the section's customization options to match the video thumbnail or embed background to your site’s theme for a cohesive look.
- **Troubleshooting:** If a custom embed doesn’t display as expected, check if the embed code size can be customized before pasting it in. Script-based embeds may not display correctly in edit mode but should appear correctly on the live site.

## Ideas
**Suggested Combinations:** 
- **Simple Call To Action:** Add below the video to direct viewers to related content or actions.
- **Text Break Review:** Place before or after the embed to feature customer reviews related to the video content.
